                    <p>I've been close to a computer since an early age, and been passionate about
                        it ever since.</p>
                    <p>I'm a visual learner and a self-taught developer with 2+ years of professional experience 
                        in turning ideas into projects. I primarily engage in front-end development using 
                        <span> React, Javascript</span> and like to explore & learn different things in my spare time.</p>
                    <p>I'm interested in building something awesome with code & automate tasks with code, currently 
                        focused on <span> Web Development, Open Source</span> and <span>Competitive Programming.</span></p>
                    <p>When I'm not coding I watch movies or play cricket with my friends! <i className="fa-solid fa-heart"></i></p>
